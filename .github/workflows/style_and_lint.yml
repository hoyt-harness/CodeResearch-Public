# .github/workflows/style_and_lint.yml

name: Code Style and Linting

# Trigger this workflow only on Pull Requests (PRs):
on:
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]  # Only run for PRs targeting the main branch.

# Permissions are set to default (read/write) for public repos, but
# specifying is good practice. We only need to set the status (write to
# pull-requests). Enforce least privilege for the token used by the
# workflow:
permissions:
  contents: read # Needs read access to check out the code.
  pull-requests: write # Needs write access to set the PR status.
