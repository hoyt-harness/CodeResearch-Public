# Flake8 is the linter. It checks for style, complexity, and errors.
# NOTE: Flake8 does not natively support pyproject.toml, but tools like
# `flake8-pyproject` or modern linters like Ruff (recommended alternative) do.
# If using vanilla Flake8, you'll need a separate `.flake8` file or use Ruff.

[tool.ruff]
# Ruff is an extremely fast linter and formatter that consolidates Flake8, isort, etc.
# Given your technical background, this is the superior, modern choice.
# This section REPLACES the need for a complex Flake8 config.

# E = pycodestyle errors, F = pyflakes errors, B = bugbear (common source of bugs)

    # E501: Line too long. Black handles this, and Ruff can check after Black.

# Ruff's built-in formatter section
[tool.ruff.format]
# The format settings automatically follow the linting settings (like line-length)
# and ensure compatibility with the Black style.
